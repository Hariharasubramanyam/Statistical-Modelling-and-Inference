Variables: phi is features matrix, w is covariates / coefficients vector, so MLE estimation is of w to best fit t?

I don't understand intuitively the Hat matrix: How does this represent residuals if it is only the result of the components of the features matrix?

(Slide 6) Where is the q coming from? Just a stand-in for the variance? (Bishop notation?)

(Bishop) Is he using E(w) on page 5 just to confuse me?
