# 1. The Laplace distribution

## 1. Write down the likelihood for $\mu$, $\Lambda$

$\prod_{n=1} \frac{1}{2}\Lambda e^{-\Lambda |t_{n} - \mu|}$

## 2. Show that

$\mu_{mle} = median(t_{1}, ..., t_{N})$

The likelihood function expands to:

$f(\mu,\Lambda) = \frac{1}{2} \Lambda e^{\sum_{n} -\Lambda |t_{n}-\mu|}$

Maximizing the likelihood function is equivalent to maximizing the log of the likelihood function.

$log(f(\mu,\Lambda)) = log(\frac{1}{2}) + log(\Lambda) + \sum_{n} -\Lambda |t_{n}-\mu|$

Taking the derivate with respect to $\mu$ and set equal to 0:

$-\Lambda \sum_{n} |t_{n} - \mu| = 0$

If $N$ is odd there are $\frac{N-1}{2}$ cases where $t_{n} < \mu$ and for the other $\frac{N-1}{2}$ cases $\t_{n} > \mu$ and thus we have an equality with zero and the median of $\t_{n}$ is $\mu_{mle}$. If $N$ is even, there is no way to satisfy this equality but we can minimize it by taking either $\frac{t_{n}}{N}$ or $\fract{t_{n}}{N-1}$
