## 2.2 P-value

### 1. Distribution of the p-value under the null

1. Show that for any $\alpha$, $c_{\alpha} = F_{H}^{-1}(1 - \alpha)$

We know that $\alpha = 1 - F_{H}(c_{\alpha})$ from the definition of $c_{\alpha}$.

We use this to solve for $F_{H}^{-1}(1 - \alpha)$:

Move $F_{H}$ to the LHS: $-F_{H}(c_{\alpha}) = \alpha - 1$

Multiply both sides by -1: $F_{H}(c_{\alpha}) = 1 - \alpha$

To produce the inverse: $F_{H}^{-1}(1 - \alpha) = c_{\alpha}$ (which proves the equation and we can stop here)

Now we check the assertion $c_{\alpha} = F_{H}^{-1}(1 - \alpha)$:

We can replace $c_{\alpha}$ in the equation for $\alpha$ and these are equivalent:

$\alpha = 1 - F_{H}(F_{H}^{-1}(1 - \alpha))$

$\alpha = 1 - F_{H}(c_\alpha)$
