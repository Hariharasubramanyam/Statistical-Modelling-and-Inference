Notes from Gelman & Hill

## Chapter 18

`lm` function in R computes $\beta^{MLE} = (\textbf{X}^{T} \textbf{X})^{-1} \textbf{X} y$ which results in a best fit (least square of errors) for the parameters.

**weighted least squares ($\beta^{WLS}$):** Adds a W matrix for weighting each observation as having relatively more or less influence on the optimization:

$$\beta^{WLS} = (\textbf{X}^{T} W \textbf{X})^{-1} \textbf{X}^{T} W y$$
