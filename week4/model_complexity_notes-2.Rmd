# Model Complexity

Pulling features in and out of the model.

One way to measure the cross-entropy is to estimate the bias

## Marginal Likelihood

Leveraging the machinery - measure model one and model two, compare 2 models, going to balance the model fit and how complexity.

Which of all these models is more interesting to me?

"one step of the conjugate gradient optimization algorithm"

Questions:

* Why measure distance in terms of least false parameters and not the distance between estimates and observed or between models
