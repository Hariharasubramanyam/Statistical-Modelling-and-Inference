# Setup Regression

* Analyzing coefficent with s.e. - sign matters, some apparently significant (by magnitude) features, may actually, due to variance, cross into negative values within it's confidence interval.

* Clinical vs statistical significance. "Everything is significant with big data". The question is really if the difference matters to me.

* **Principal components** distance measured perpendicularly from regression line

* **MLE** regression to the mean, distance measured vertically
